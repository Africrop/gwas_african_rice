# gwas_african_rice

This repository contains scripts necessary to replicate the GWAS analysis made on African rice *Oryza glaberrima* reported in the publication XXXX.
We also provide a genotypic file with imputated missing data (see article for details) as the replication of the imputation could results in slightly different outcomes.
